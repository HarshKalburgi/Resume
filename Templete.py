- Improve clarity, structure, and wording while keeping all original details accurate.
- Organize content into logical sections (Personal Information, Summary, Education, Skills, Projects, Experience) if the data is provided in the section then use the given sections else dont add the section.
- Generate a concise, impactful Personal Summary at the top, highlighting strengths and relevant keywords from the job description if provided.
- Categorize skills into meaningful groups (e.g., Programming Languages, Web Development, AI/ML, Cloud & DevOps, Soft Skills, etc.).
